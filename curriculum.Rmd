### Slides
Slides for talks given by project team members

[An Introduction to Applied Network Research](https://prezi.com/dbcbtsttjlqc/?token=95c410b34e45897a60b516de7b7678cff1d3d8cd7ad2c1850b65aeda3e7a624d&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share)

[Another 'Introduction to Network Analysis' Presentation](https://networkingarchives.github.io/lecture_slides)

[Distant Reading Large Correspondence Archives Using Networks](https://yann-ryan.github.io/hnr_slides) (Historical Networks Research Conference, 2021).

[The Impact of Mobility on an Early Modern Correspondence Network](https://yann-ryan.github.io/netsci-slides.html) (Netsci Conference, 2021)

### Notebooks and exercises 
These are interactive 'notebooks': documents containing text and snippets of code which can be run live. They are made available on a service called MyBinder, which will load a version of the notebook in a server. 

[Interactive NetworkX Python tutorial](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/networkingarchives/trainingschool/3e4208eeee3917fa6c88c2bd5cfe93a7e6535606) (once the Binder loads, click on 'Python and NetworkX.ipynb' to load the notebook)

[Interactive R Tutorial](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yann-ryan/dh_intro_gates/main?urlpath=rstudio)  (R notebooks in MyBinder can be particularly slow to load, be patient!)

[Network Analysis with Palladio](https://yann-ryan.github.io/network_analysis_palladio)

[Network Analysis Exercise](https://yann-ryan.github.io/student_assignment_groningen)
