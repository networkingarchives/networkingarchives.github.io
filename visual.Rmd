With this tool you can browse the State Papers correspondence using a series of visual guides. Each step should be completed in the correct order: first, select sender(s) and recipient(s) using the drop-down menu. Next, enter a keyword in the search box and hit the search button: this will display a bar chart of the keyword hits over time on the right-hand panel. Select a time period by clicking and dragging a box over the desired area in the bar chart, and the origins of these letters will be displayed on the mini-map. Lastly, draw a box around an area of interest using the map tools, and click to display the relevant network of letters sent from those origins. 

Clicking on a link between two nodes will display the letters between those two individuals, in the panel on the left. 

At the moment, the years 1660-1670 (inclusive) are included, as a demonstration.
