This tool enables users to facet the State Papers correspondence using a series of visual guides: first, select sender(s) and recipient(s) using the drop-down menu on the right. Next, search for a keyword, which displays a bar chart of the keyword hits over time. Select a time period by dragging a box and results are displayed on the mini-map. Lastly, draw a box around an area of interest using the map tools, and click to display the relevant network of letters sent from those origins. 

Clicking on each link will display the letters between those two individuals.
