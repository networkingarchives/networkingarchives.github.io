**LETTER 1**

**Author:** Thomas Smith \
**Recipient:** Dr. White \
**Title:** Th. Smithe to Dr. White. \
**Day:** Dec. 11. \
**Year:** [1591]

-I have been here these four days to make proof how this University standeth affected to my Lord. And of fourteen score voices, which are all that are in the University, and the greatest number that is seen at any election here, I find two hundred, or very near that number, professed for my Lord. Nevertheless the trouble of collecting these voices by hands maketh me stay somewhat longer than I purposed, partly because the men being dispersed in divers places, and some of them out of town, are not readily to be spoken withal, and partly because some extraordinary means are used here by those which have otherwise disposed their affection, and especially by Dr. Bonde, to dissuade and deter men from professing their voices for my Lord. I certify you hereof, that you may, as I pray you to do, in this meanwhile 163163of my absence find the means to speak with my Lord Treasurer or Sir Robert Cecil, and inform them how the matter standeth. All the life that the other part hath is in this, that they think and give out the nomination will be at Court, and not permitted to the University; in which course though I should not doubt but the matter would proceed well enough for my Lord, yet I hope their Honours will be a mean for the maintenance of the privilege and liberty of this University, and suffer the ordinary and orderly way of election to take place.-From Oxford in haste this 11 of December. _Signed._

_Addressed_:-"To the worshipful my very good freend Mr. D. White at his house near St. Dunstan's church in Fleet Street."

**LETTER 2**

**Author:** Thomas Smith  \
**Recipient:** William Cecil, Lord Burghley \
**Document Ref.:** SP 63/39 f.152 \
**Day:** No date \
**Year:** 1573

The suppliants entered 40 last of herring in the custom house this present month of March for which they paid 12d the last in subsidy.

The merchants of Ireland claim freedom from payment of custom by their charters. They have many times been permitted to pass without paying custom by putting in bonds to show the charters but they have never done this. By the suits of the earls of Ormond and Desmond and others to the late lord treasurer, they have got themselves to be discharged, alleging that their herring was shotten herring and so worth little money here; and they themselves poor and should be utterly undone if they paid anything.

Their charters may show that they may pay subsidy but not custom. They should not look to be more free than the merchants of London or the merchants of the five ports who have the greatest charters of all.

They allege they paid subsidy at home but that is not sufficient answer why they should not pay subsidy here.

The statute of subsidy charges all manner of merchandise crossing the seas by a stranger both with custom and subsidy and the queen's subjects with subsidy only: 15d per last for the stranger and 12d per last for the Englishman.

Where they allege that they brought their herring here for the victualling of the city so do the merchants of this city and elsewhere but they answer the subsidy.

**Day: **May 8** \
Year: **1572

“Ye have not written to me when I have written so many letters for you and in your favour. Belike either your conscience doth accuse you that ye have played the fool in taking that upon you which ye could not perform, or ye thought that now I should espy your folly and demands unreasonable of me.“So long have I followed your follies that 1 must be weary; yet my nephew Wood writes so wisely that for his sake I will do something,” but except you show hereafter more foresight, doubt and provision for the worst in all points, than hitherto 1 have seen, I will hereafter take you for a fantastical fool and give you a long _Adieu_. Now it standeth upon your making or marring, and therefore take heed and lose no time.”—Paris, 8th of May.
